                <h2>Teachers Day</h2>
                <p>CMSHS values its teachers deeply, and by that, every year during the celebrations of Teacher's Day, students are handpicked
                    by teachers to teach in their stead so that other students may still learn while the teachers take a well-deserved break.
                    This year, the City of Mandaluyong Science High School (CMSHS) celebrated National Teachers' Month 2025 with a "Stellar"-themed
                    program on October 3 at the school grounds. Organized by the Supreme Secondary Learner Government (SSLG), the three-hour
                    celebration featured a teachers' parade with medal awards, student teacher recognition, video tributes, gift-giving ceremonies,
                    and musical performances by students, concluding with individual classroom celebrations.</p>
