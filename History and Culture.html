                <h2>MANDSCI back then!</h2>
                <p>CMSHS was founded in response to the growing need for specialized science education in the Philippines. 
                    The school has since developed a reputation for academic excellence, consistently producing top-performing students in national and international competitions. 
                    The culture at CMSHS emphasizes collaboration, innovation, and a strong sense of community among students and faculty.</p>

                <h2>Modern Development</h2>
                <p>Before, sections of classes were named after Filipino (Second and Fourth Year) and foreign scientists (First and Third year).
                    In 2009, sections of classes were named after elements in the Periodic table in School year 2013-2014,
                    sections were named after constellations, scientists, units of measurement, and molecular and atomic parts.</p>
